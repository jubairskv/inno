Next-Generation Digital eKYC Plugin for Seamless Identity Verification
InnoTrust-RN-ETH is a cutting-edge React Native SDK built to power instant, secure, and scalable eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) processes for mobile and web applications. Designed specifically with Ethiopia's digital ID infrastructure in mind, it delivers a seamless onboarding experience by combining speed, accuracy, and advanced AI-driven verification features.

🔐 Key Features
✅ ID Card OCR & Data Extraction
Leverages powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to automatically scan and extract personal data from both the front and back of National ID cards. This ensures rapid data capture with high precision, minimizing user input and friction.

✅ Facial Verification & Matching
Performs facial recognition to match the selfie taken by the user with the photo extracted from their ID card—validating that the identity truly belongs to the person undergoing verification.

✅ Active Liveness Detection
Implements real-time liveness checks to confirm that the user is physically present and not using a static image or video. This prevents spoofing attempts and strengthens anti-fraud protection.

✅ Tamper Detection
Analyzes ID images for any signs of tampering, manipulation, or forgery—ensuring the document's integrity and authenticity before proceeding with verification.

✅ Fast Integration & Customization
With its plug-and-play architecture, developers can easily embed the SDK into existing mobile applications. The SDK supports full UI customization while maintaining a standard workflow and robust backend integration.
