Face Verification: Uses facial recognition to compare a user's selfie with the photo on their ID card to confirm identity.
Liveliness Check: Ensures that the person undergoing verification is physically present and not using a static photo or video, adding an extra layer of security.
Tamper Detection: Detects any signs of manipulation or alteration in the ID card, ensuring the authenticity of the document being used.
InnoKYC simplifies the user verification process while maintaining the highest standards of security, making it ideal for mobile applications that require reliable and instantaneous KYC procedures.
